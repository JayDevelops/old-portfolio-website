              <p class="summaryParagraph">
                Many people start spilling the tea with others because it's an easy thing to do, as humans we tend to focus on the negative rather than the positive in life.
               <br>
                This is more truthful when we have the people who sit at the side of the coffee shop mainly known for their caramel macchiato's,
                who are spilling tea when we all know they're sipping on their coffee.

                Never settle for less, never settle for anything you don't want in life.
               <br><br>
                This can be applicable to all aspects of life, yet I will take it from a relationship context. Don't ever settle for the people you don't deserve in life, or want in your life. Don't demand for the people you do want in your life, command the people you want in your life.

                I talked to my boy, let's call him Danny who preaches on and on about his presentation going extremely well.
                The other kids in the class cheered his name out loud, tearing a hole in the ceiling, "DANNY, DANNY, DANNY"
                and the teacher (named Mrs. Betty) giving him a big A+ on his presentation and the same day the girl who
