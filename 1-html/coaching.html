      <h1 class="startHeading">Before We Start</h1>
      <h2 class="talkOfMe">Let's Talk About Me... Then Charisma...</h2>
        <p class="beenThere">
          First you learn, then you take the "l". You learn then you fail, then you earn something in return which is as valuable as opening your eyes for the first time in this w  orld.
          I wouldn't be saying this if I weren't to have gained more in life as receiving $2,000 from one single sales pitch for my friend <a href="">Yash</a>, gaining meaningful relationships in both
          of intamacy and platonically, and growing my Instagram page over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jay.develops/" style="#004d99">1,000+</a> followers. Getting negotiations down to an exact science, speaking with conviction in every normal day to day sentence to speaking to many which stretch out like the pacific ocean.
          While you read this with your tired eyes, wanting something more out of life, you question if this is legit or is this a scam or he's fake. I tell you to believe what you want to believe,
          I can't force anything on you so please click away from this website because I don't want you. I ONLY want the people who actually want to literally transform their lives through your eyes, to start
          from scratch all over again and let me completely honest here- I wasn't here at first.
          <br> <br>
          I wasn't born with this thing called "Charisma", I was in a dark place at the beginning of my childhood not knowing
          where to turn for love and affection, other than turning to a closed wall only to weep salty rivers coursing through my eyes.
          I couldn't go up to any hot, beautiful, warm girl because I will gasp and lose my breath only to look at her and my frienships were the same.
          I couldn't hold a conversation to save my own life, I couldn't captivate others in a single room, I feared of not being liked in another room.
          Then I said, I HAD ENOUGH. I had enough of all the wallowing, all the negativity forced upon me through external and internal factors.
          I am not telling this story to want pity, or attention. I am telling you this because I am empathizing with you, to
          clear your doubts of me because I was there. I went from not having anything to having many things being offered to me with my exceptional
          social and emotional skills, heck I was offered a developer job when I was underqualified for a starting of $30 per hour only by selling
          myself and making a long lasting first impression with the boss. To dating phenomenal beautiful girls and talking to them without breaking a sweat!
          <br><br>
          Now, we're left with "What's Charisma?" and what types are there? Charisma is the ability to make others feel a certain manner, whether it be
          special or susceptible, with how you say things with your body, actions, and words.
          <br><br>
          There's seven types of charisma, as I define them as the following.
          Of course, you can mix these charisma types as if they were sundae toppins to make the ice cream (your self) to stand out from the crowd.
          Pair praiseful and egotistical to let others know you can't be messed with when they harm you yet you make others feel special in conversations
          and events. Mix Authoritative, Egotistical, Praiseful, and Conviction to lead others in a group project or drive your business to go public
          as you will be respected as a trustful, impactful, empathic yet logical charismatic individual which are the four types related to leadership, etc.
          <br><br>
          Listen, charisma can be taught, which I teach in a phenomenal and concise manner, and once you learned it- you will gain the most out of life.
          You will gain more in a relationsip, social, intimate, and financial manner in your life. Living the best life you could ever ask for, so scroll
          all the way down to get your FREE RESOURCE of making a killer and phenomenal first impression to anyone you meet in your grand life!
          It wont cost you a cent, it won't cost you a macro of your time, and you will get so much out by signing up. Don't lose out on this opportunity,
          as this one resource usually costs up to $100 yet I am giving it to you FOR FREE TODAY. Don't lose out on this amazing deal.
          Alternatively, it won't cost you nada(nothing) to scroll all the way down to get a booking with me which I will personally coach you charisma on the phone or in person.
          (I currently am based in the Los Angeles Area).
